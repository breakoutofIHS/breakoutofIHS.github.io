You made it!

On this website, there are two text fields. This is where you will enter passwords (case sensitive). Press the button under each text field to submit a password.
If you get the password right, another box will turn green.
There are 5 clues in each section. You can solve both sections simultaneously. The passwords you find will lead you to the rest of the clues.
You already solved the first problem: getting to this site. Now you need to solve the other 9.

I'll give you a hint for the first password for the bottom row: It's on the main site.

Good luck.
