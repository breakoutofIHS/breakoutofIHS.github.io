I'm thinking of a fruit.

The first part of the password is the first letter of the fruit's name converted from hexidecimal to decimal.
The second part is the fruit's name, in all capital letters, reversed.
The third part is the number of vowels that appear in the fruit's name.
The fourth part is the number of letters that appear before the first vowel in the word.
The last part is the number of letters in the fruit's name.
